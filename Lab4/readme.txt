in this lab we where tasked to create a high level prototype of a virtual museum webpage  using AdobeXD , not only did we learn how to create prototypes in the program ,
but we went on to explore page interactions, such as swiping through image galleries , or tapping on objects to get a better view of them. 

 for my lab I designed the american museum of natural history
