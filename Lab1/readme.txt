This lab was intendened not only to get us use to the technology of StoriesOnBoard, but also to get used to making storyboard that does not have any implamentation ideas attached to it, such as a user clicking a button to do an action, that is not what storyboarding is supposed to be  

I was asked to  implament extra features into my design on stories on board 
for my extra feature I tried was not only to annotate the "review queue cards" card to indicate it's dependency on annother card 
I also changed the colour of the task card to indicate that this task is an advanced task and has no basic task component
