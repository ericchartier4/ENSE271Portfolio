This lab I was asked to review a website , create a site map , and catalog the website assets,  I saw this not only as an introduction of how to use a design product , AdobeXD. but also being able document an existing design , this may help find missed defects in the design , as well as give documentation to help identify were certain assets may be if they need to be changed at some later point , such as copy write 

 the site I  used : https://www.treasurescakes.com/
